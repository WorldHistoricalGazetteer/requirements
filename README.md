## World-Historical Gazetteer User Stories

This repository is a gathering place for user stories (requirements, wishes, etc.) for the [World-Historical Gazetteer project]("http://whgazetteer.org"), in the form:

#### **As a { <span style="color:red">user type/role</span> } I want to {<span style="color:red">some goal</span>} so that {<span style="color:red">some reason</span>}**

For example, "As a **user**, I want to {**search a geographic area (i.e. space rather than place)**} in order to {**find sources relating to places in this area**}"

The project will build a Linked Open Data historical gazetteer of named and typed cultural and physical geographic places, by

* creating **_a global "spinal" gazetteer_** of some 30,000 significant named places
* linking that spine with contributed specialist gazetteer data in a **_union index_**
* building **_a web interface_** to search, browse, and visualize the entire dataset
* developing **_an application programming interface (API)_** to enable machine access to, and downloading of, the entire dataset

To help us ensure these project products are useful and usable, please add your requirements and desired functionality for any aspect of this system as Issues in this Repo. **NOTE: You must have a GitHub account to do this**.

1. On the Issues tab, click the "New Issue" button
1. Use the content of your "I want to" phrase as the title
1. Enter your entire User Story sentence in the "write/leave a comment" box
1. From the panel on the right, add a "user story" label to the issue
1. Click "Submit new issue"

You can use the first issue/story as an example. It's fine to make "user type/role" simply "**user**" but if you want to be more precise, feel free.
