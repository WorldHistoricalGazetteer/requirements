World-Historical Gazetteer is a [University of Pittsburgh World History Center](http://www.worldhistory.pitt.edu/) project supported by the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov). The project has a three-year term, ending in May 2020.

We are building build a Linked Open Data historical gazetteer of named and typed cultural and physical geographic places, by

* creating **_a global "spinal" gazetteer_** of some 30,000 significant named places. It will include not only _polities_, _administrative districts_, and significant _settlements_, but _ethnonyms_, _language regions_, named _historical routes_, and _physical geographic features_ such as mountain ranges, rivers, watersheds, ecoregions (biomes), and ocean currents. It will focus significantly but not exclusively on the centuries since 1500, so as to dovetail with synergistic efforts devoted to the ancient and medieval world like [Pelagios](http://commons.pelagios.org) and the [Pleiades gazetteer of ancient places](http://pleiades.stoa.org).
* linking that spine with contributed specialist gazetteer data in a **_union index_**, rich with links to associated place records and other data
* building **_a web interface_** to search, browse, visualize, and download contents of that index
* developing **_an application programming interface (API)_** to enable machine access to the entire dataset
