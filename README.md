The World-Historical Gazetteer is a University of Pittsburgh World History Center project supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

We are building build a Linked Open Data historical gazetteer of named and typed cultural and physical geographic places, by

* creating **_a global "spinal" gazetteer_** of some 30,000 significant named places
* linking that spine with contributed specialist gazetteer data in a **_union index_**
* building **_a web interface_** to search, browse, and visualize the entire dataset
* developing **_an application programming interface (API)_** to enable machine access to, and downloading of, the entire dataset
