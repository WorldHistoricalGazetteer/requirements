## World-Historical Gazetteer User Stories

The [Issues section of this repository](issues) is a gathering place for user stories (requirements, wishes, etc.) for this project, in the form:

#### **As a { <span style="color:red">user type/role</span> } I want to {<span style="color:red">some goal</span>} so that {<span style="color:red">some reason</span>}**

For example, "As a **user**, I want to {**search a geographic area (i.e. space rather than place)**} so that {**I can find sources relating to places in this area**}"

To help us ensure these project products are useful and usable, you can add comments to any of the issues. If you have a requirement that isn't covered by any of these, you can add it. **NOTE: You will need a GitHub account**.

1. On the Issues tab, click the "New Issue" button
1. Use the content of your "I want to" goal phrase as the title
1. Enter your entire User Story sentence in the "write/leave a comment" box
1. From the panel on the right, add labels: "user story" and the label for one or more appropriate classification, e.g. "c. search interface"
1. Click "Submit new issue"

You can use any issue/story as an example. It's fine to make "user type/role" simply "**user**" but if you want to be more precise, feel free.
